## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

How to make responsive web app using bootstarp 5 and how to customize responsive using css

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media (max-width: 991px) {
  .result {
    border-bottom-left-radius: 10%;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 10%;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I think I should learn more and practice using bootstrap

### Useful resources

- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for styling css.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/) - This helped me for how to use bootstrap 5.
